/**
 * Build a Reusable Autocomplete Component:

Implement an autocomplete component in React that fetches suggestions from an API as the user types.
Consider performance optimization (debouncing, caching), accessibility (aria attributes), and user experience (handling loading states, error states).
This tests your React skills, API interaction, and attention to detail.
