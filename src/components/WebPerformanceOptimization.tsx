/**Web Performance Optimization

Scenario: You're given a code snippet of a web page (or a description of a web page's behavior) and asked to identify and address performance bottlenecks.

Example:

A web page displays a large grid of images. It loads slowly, and scrolling is janky. The code uses map() to render all images at once.
What Interviewers Look For:

Identification of Bottlenecks: Your ability to pinpoint the causes of poor performance (e.g., rendering too many elements, inefficient algorithms, excessive network requests).
Optimization Techniques: Your knowledge of techniques like:

Virtualization: Rendering only the visible portion of the grid.
Lazy Loading: Loading images only when they are about to become visible.
Code Splitting: Loading only the necessary JavaScript code for the current view.
Caching: Storing assets to reduce network requests.
Metrics: Your understanding of web performance metrics (e.g., Largest Contentful Paint, First Input Delay).
Trade-offs: Your ability to discuss the trade-offs between different optimization techniques. */
